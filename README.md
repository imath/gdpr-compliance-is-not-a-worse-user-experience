# GDPR is not a worse user experience.

## Update

WordPress core team fixed the issue in changeset [44659](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/44659). If you're using WordPress 5.1.0-beta2 or up, you don't need this plugin.

## 4.9.6 <= your WordPress version < 5.1.0-beta2

The goal of this plugin is to avoid a regression about user experience that WordPress 4.9.6 decided to leave unfixed.

In short: the fact a user did not consent to store their personal data within browser cookies is not a valuable reason to provide him with a worse user experience.

See WordPress Core ticket [#43857](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/43857) for more information about the issue the plugin is fixing.
